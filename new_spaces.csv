Due to introduction of  mechanisation, automation and methods of mass production, goods produced by the organised industrial sector became so cheap that rural artisans  could not compete with them. Destruction of the traditional rural  enterprises led to pauperisation of rural India. The recent changes in  economic conditions, such as increase in the cost of fossil fuels,  increase in the cost of transport and the increased overhead expenses of operating modern industrial units, offer a chance to revive rural,  family owned enterprises, which would use locally available raw material and sell their products locally. ARTI was founded in 1996 by a group of about 20 scientists and technologists to develop innovative and  environmentally friendly rural technologies based on modern scientific  knowledge. ARTI endeavors to help the rural people in establishing new  enterprises. ARTI also maintains a Rural Entrepreneurship Development  Centre in a rural location in the State of Maharashtra, India. Potential rural entrepreneurs are trained at this Centre in the technologies  developed by ARTI.

","Clovis, CA", CA,"Located at the Center for Advanced Research and Technology (CART) in the Central Valley of California, this FabLab focuses on Product Development and Robotics in an immersive high school environment. The Center for Advanced Research and Technology (CART) is an integrated high school in Clovis, CA. With students from 15 different schools in two districts coming together in a career and college focused environment. Our goal is to bring our educational model to the community at large through the lens of the FabLab model and charter.

"open,fab_lab",Entrepreneur,North America,Champaign-Urbana Community Fab Lab,,,,United States,"1301 S Goodwin Ave, Art Annex 2 61801, It's across the street from the ACES library (the octagon-shaped building)",Urbana,,"We work with a local and international network to actively cultivate UIUC public engagement through community-focused art, entrepreneurship, research and education. The Champaign-Urbana Community Fab Lab is an open and collaborative workshop space for computer-driven innovation, design and fabrication. We enable makers of all kinds to imagine, design and create using open source software and DIY equipment. We do this by working with a local and international network to actively cultivate public engagement through community-focused art, entrepreneurship, research and education.Physically, our Fab Lab is an advanced workshop space for rapid prototyping and computer-based design.It consists of a suite of fabrication machines, including a laser engraver, CNC routers, 3D printers and scanners, electronic cutters, digital textile machines, small board electronics, graphic drawing tablets, advanced software and more. We collaborate with several grant projects and community partners locally to provide similar tools at a variety of other locations, including public libraries and after-school centers.Culturally, the CUC Fab Lab is driven by a community of practice, people often referred to as Makers.Open-Source Movement Makers like us are are united by the desire to share knowledge, collaborate and to ___make almost anything.___ Our lab is open to the public, employs both staff and volunteers and greatly values both diversity and play, as we believe these are necessary for innovation. Our network and patrons include people of all kinds: students, teens, families, entrepreneurs, artists, hobbyists, gamers, hackers, engineers, scientists, teachers, librarians, activists and more. We welcome those interested to join the conversation and discover more about who we are!Functionally, Fab Labs encourage people to become makers by exploring the entire design process.They do this by providing tools, human assistance and inspiration that enable people to go from (1) concepts and questions to (2) digital designs and models to (3) physical prototypes and redesigns to (4) a final product they can share, which may in turn help others begin the cycle. This process is rather unique because it is possible for people with little technological expertise to engage in design thinking to develop complex creations using technology and knowledge previously only available to expert artists and engineers. Our lab specializes in working with individuals, groups and organizations to provide makerspace curriculum and related programming.Organizationally, our Fab Lab is a public engagement program of the Illinois Informatics Institute.We work with a variety of units, including The Graduate School of Library and Information Science, Department of Business Administration, School of Art and Design and Institute for Computing in Humanities, Arts and Social Sciences to collaborate on grants, facilitate classes and support research. Although many places might be referred to as a fab lab, our Fab Lab is part of the global network connected to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) Center for Bits and Atoms. This collaborative network connects institutions around the world with common tools, software platforms and ideologies to facilitate the open exchange of ideas and designs.Philosophically, we believe the open source ethos of the Fab Lab inspires interest and innovation in many fields.We strive to connect computer-based making and rapid fabrication to many areas, like art and design, computer science, architecture, engineering, mathematics, science, and technical trades. We think community access, provided at a reasonable cost and in cooperation with the global Fab Lab network, builds local capacities by enabling personal growth, economic development and cross-cultural understanding. Activities at the Fab Lab and our partner sites embody the principle of life-long learning by cultivating digital literacies, including cognitive skills like computational, divergent or critical thinking, but also related cultural competencies and other underlying traits that prove fundamental to holistic learning, such as civic engagement or confidence with art and technology.",Fab Lab,fablab,communityfablab@gmail.com,cucfablab.org,,https://www.facebook.com/pages/Champaign-Urbana-Community-Fab-Lab/177273545636056,40.1019,-88.2248,,,,,,,,,,,,,2009,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Jeff,Ginger,Board,http://movement.open.co/sites/default/files/styles/medium/public/champaign-urbana-community-fab-lab.jpeg?itok=R2Whnzey,"Making, Learning","Community, Tech",Physical,Local,,,,,1301 S Goodwin Av,,Illinois,Urbana,61801,"1301 S Goodwin Av,  Illinois, Urbana, 61801","Part of the Fab Lab network, a global collection of small-scale workshops containing the tools for personal digital fabrication.",Makerspace,40.1105875,-88.2072697,,,,,,,,

A Fab Lab (fabrication laboratory) is a community-oriented workshop consisting of high tech tools and cutting edge machinery. Most of the hardware featured in these work spaces are easily controlled by user friendly software programs installed on desktop computers no different than the ones we use at work or home. The intent of the Fab Lab is to put this sophisticated machinery in the hands of students as young as middle school exposing them to engineering and design by giving them the opportunity to turn ideas into tangible products.The Fab Lab concept began as an outreach program at MIT that aimed to promote creativity and innovation among students. By giving students the necessary tools and fostering an environment where imagination to invent and create was encouraged, Fab Labs quickly gained popularity with fab labs now being created in opened in rural India, northern Norway, Afghanistan, Ghana, Boston and Costa Rica. Users are finding that students who are able to apply design and engineering concepts toward the creation of real things are able to learn much more than they could through just exams or textbooks.This has definitely been the case at CITC's fab lab, where Alaskan Native students are discovering the sky's the limit when working within a supportive community with access to the right tools. With some basic instruction and training provided by an on-site adviser, students who often struggle in a traditional educational environment are now running many of the standard machines in the Fab Lab __ç 3D printers, laser and vinyl cutters __ç to create a wide range of products made from wood, metal and plastic. This type of hands-on learning experience exposes the students to a wide range of design, engineering and architectural concepts in a fun, holistic way that cannot be achieved in the classroom. When students transform a simple idea into a tangible finished product, they get an overwhelming sense of accomplishment __ç not to mention a lot of handy products. Some of the student-created items proudly on display in the workshop include decorative wool scarves, a Spanish-style classical guitar, personalized paper stationary, and even spare automotive parts.

After that, they are given a chance to demonstrate how far they have developed and are provided with the opportunity to further their cause.

Parmesh Shahani, the founder of the Lab says, _India is an important world power. Its contemporary culture  needs to be chronicled, amplified and debated across interdisciplinary  silos. Hopefully the conversations that we enable will lead to insights, connections and serendipitous collaborations among its participants."" The Lab_s interactions take the shape of curated events of different  sizes, most of which are held within the Godrej campus in Vikhroli and  are free and open to attend for all _ Godrej employees as well as  members of the general public (RSVP is required for non-Godrej  attendees).

For him,  technology is the evolution of ideas and that is exactly what he is  doing to bring comfort and freedom to his society.   For most of human history,  technology was mainly the province of craftmen who passed their  know-how down from generation to generation; gradually improving  designs and adding new techniques and materials. Today, technology has  become a large scale enterprise that depended on a large stores of  know-how that has become too large for one society to master.   Like every human being, Apostle  Safo was gifted with a sizeable brain and favourable thumbs which  afford him a near unique ability to make real the innovations that he  imagines. He has a unique inspiration and remit his creativity and  notion to express his ideas into something real and tangible.  Realising that technology has  changed the social system of humans and their behavioral patterns and  still increasing the rapidness of research and development of  societies, he is of the view that, if Africa should invest in  technolgical innovations, poverty will be a thing of the past. Modern technology has come to represent the means by which  people seek to transform their culture and advance to modernity.  Africa and for that matter our traditional cultures have embraced them  into our world-view. We have adopted the products of western  technology both into our way of life as well as our mode of thought.  So why are we reluctant to contribute to it?  At Gomoa Mpota in the Central  region of Ghana, Great Kosa Suaye Technology Centre has embarked on a  lot of technological innovativeness. Call it engineering or  re-engineering, designing or redesigning, invention or re-invention,  there is still enough reason to buttress this course.      The Centre has the following departments :       £    £ Foundry and Pattern Development   £ Plant Medicine   £ Building and Construction  £ Mechanical and Automobile  £ Radio and Transmission",Appropriate Technology,"Appropriate Technology Facilities, Hackerspaces, business incubator",info@kantanka.com,kantanka.com/technologycentre.html,Tel: Tel: +233(0)21-403598 / Tel: +233 (0) 20 81 30 736,<http://www.aljazeera.com/news/africa/2014/08/ghana-talented-but-ignored-inventors-2014823191921173432.html> <http://africarm.org/publications/inventions-list/> <http://www.modernghana.com/news/509451/1/living-tomorrow-in-the-kristo-asafo-kingdom.html>,5.44,-0.61,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Gomoa Mpota village along Kasoa-Winneba road, Gomoa Mpota, Central Region, Ghana",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The word gram, which means village in Hindi, is used to describe the functional and self-sufficient nature of the communities. We are excited by technology and innovation, but recognize that  people come first. We believe that innovation is valuable only when it  serves people. The solutions we are looking at are in now way final, and will continue to evolve over time. HackerGram is a work in progress._ Deepta_s Version _ _An initiative to bring people together to pursue their independent  goals while building a sustainable community. While we are all dealing  with wastage of resources, we thought of starting several places where  we can reuse and recycle available resources and reducing our footprints in the process._  Shu_s Version _ _ Instead of making one shelter we had to travel through 3  destinations for variety of reasons and finally we have arrived in  Jatkhedi, Bhopal in Madhya Pradesh which should be our long term  emergency shelter.   Residents of HackerGram in a relaxed moment You can read some of the experiences of the people who are living and using HackerGram facilities here: http://hackergram.org/ Key Learning: If you put only people who are dealing with emergency in one location, it is an unstable structure. Theory: It is important to balance out emergency affected individuals with people who are less under stress Hypothesis: If the emergency shelter concept is expanded and slightly altered to _community spaces_, this allows other people to be there as  well. We are experimenting with building such space. It is important for these spaces to be as independent of the  mainstream structure as possible, to prevent harassment and so forth,  when legal measures fail. Therefore we have to make it with green  architecture, off the grid etc. We will work on them in future. Doing so also attracts the community of free speech and environment supporters  who provide natural protection for people facing emergencies_ Arjun_s Version _  What is ____gram? __ _ Hai _ Hindi word for _Is_, refers to Being __ _ Kar _ Hindi word for _Do_ refers to Doing -gram _ Something written, drawn or otherwise recorded. (src _  http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/-gram) _.and it also sounds like the Hindi word for village So_ ____gram is an effort to _ Identify and locate communities committed to becoming both functional and sustainable Document and share who these communities are being and what they are doing to become sustainable and functional We do this at http://hackergram.org _ Nirvikalpa_s Version _ A film that is yet to be completed   Anando_s Version Someone once decided to perform an experiment. They put a burning  candle on a table, next to a box of thumbtacks and asked vaulanteers to  stick the candle on the wall. Vaulanteers didnt find it easy to  accomplish. They performed even worse when money was offered as a  reward. But some people did figure out after trying to melt the side of  the candle to attach it to the wall and what not, that if you remove the tacks from the box, it can be pinned on the wall putting thumb tacks  through one of its sides and then you can stand the candle on this shelf you just made. Next, the task was simplified. The box and the  thumbtacks were kept separately this time, both next to the candle. And  this time vaulanteers figured out the solution in no time. Monetary  rewards on this task improved efficiency. Now, what do we see here?  Intellectual tasks which require linear thinking (as in use of an object or objects for their obvious function) like figuring out how to use the box in the second task are better performed with a monetory reward. But finding non-linear solutions, like figuring out how to use the box  differently in the first experiment, are harder if money is the reward.  Finding solutions for sustainable living is likely to be a non-linear  task, where all the information and physical resources are present and  have constraints and one has to find useful ways of combining them. So  when most people are looking outside the box, and a Phil Dunphy is  looking inside the box, we are looking at everyone_s work and also  outside, inside and on the boundaries of the box. Our plan is to find  habitable land close to a community and set up a centre for operations  which has to be sustainable. We use all resources available to us  (internet, local knowledge, experts) to do this. Now from here we extend into the community, learning more sustainable practises and hoping the  community picks some up from us as well. And of course we dont think we  have all answers, so all our plans are crowd sourced and everyone is a  valuable contributor. The aim is to generate enough know-how to come up  with manuals for setting up these sustainable homes or communities  wherever anyone is interested. More interested people obviously means  more know-how for us. As you can see, monetory rewards are not as  important in this scheme as sustainable living itself. But maybe the  candle expt is not imp, maybe all we need tpo think about are the  communities which have been living sustainably for thousands of years  all around us and how little of their know-how is available to us. But  dont think I_m saying we are leaving cities and going to villages. No.  We are, in fact, taking all amenities we can think of to wherever we are going.

It is more than just a physical space: It is a dynamic community with ideas inspired by the Open Source philosophy.The IdeaWhile our idea stems from free and Open Source ideas, our primary motivation is our desire to share our experiences with the rest of the world.We want to share our ideas just as we share our code. We are used in sharing our data, problems and solutions remotely from our home or from our jobs. So, why not do it face to face as well?ValuesExcellenceBe polite to everyone. Respect all people that you meet at the space, as well as the space itself.SharingThe main operation of hackerspace is to promote collaboration by sharing projects, code, and ideas. The motto, which is inspired by Creative Commons, is ""I love to share"".ConsensusAll decisions are the result of consensus among members. Decisions on management of the space are taken at the monthly meetings, which are open to all.Do-ocracyYou do not need a license to work on a project. If you want to organize an event or a workshop on an Open-Source or Open-Hardware project, do not expect it to be organized by someone else.

We operate at the intersection of social and technological innovation. This provides iSpace with the unique opportunity to merge social entrepreneurs with technological entrepreneurs, truly embodying the notion of collaboration and co-creation.

Our property is very raw. The jungle here envelops you. The accommodations are basic, if beautiful. Whether it is the torrential rains of the winter season or the cicadas of the summer, the deep red mud, or the breathtaking views, the jungle will keep your senses stimulated. We co-exist with many fascinating but often unfamiliar species here. The sheer density and lushness of life is inescapable, even affronting at times. For us, this is the power of the Choza: to confront us with raw possibility, to not temper it. To juxtapose the power of natural systems with hegemony of human civilization, and contemplate their evolving relationship.

Bugisan Selatan, Gumuk Indah RT 13 RW 36, Yogyakarta (Belakang SMKI) 55182",yogyakarta,DIY,"Lifepatch is a citizen initiative that works in creative and effective applications in art, science and technology. It focuses on the arts and science through education and accessible technologies that are practical and useful for citizens around them through the development of creative and innovative practices such as biological technology, environmental technology and digital technology. In practice, Lifepatch enriches the culture emphasizes the spirit of DIY and DIWO by inviting the target audience to become involved, to examine, explore, develop and maximize the function of technology in both the theoretical and practical use to society and culture itself.Lifepatchês main focus is in disseminating tactics for dealing with day-to-day issues within specific communities, mainly through education, collaborating with individuals and communities from art and science, either from formal or non-formal practical background. It collaborates closely with formal educational institutes such as the Microbiology Laboratory of Agriculture Faculty Gadjah Mada University, Yogyakarta, to initiate projects combining professionals and amateurs in citizen art and science. Lifepatch consciously chose to style itself as a _citizen initiative” in order to not limit the results of its activities just to an art outcome/artwork. It sets a flexible platform and conditions for its members to initiate projects that can be implemented according to the needs of the surroundings, society, the public and the people, yet which are still based on each personês own interests and the communityês vision. In talking of a target audience, Lifepatch is pointing at different groups of people depending on what they are working on. Each target group then has the chance to be more than just participants but also to develop, hack or disseminate a shared idea. To reach a wider audience, Lifepatch combines real physical activities with a virtual platform to share the knowledge and expanding networks both locally and internationally.",,"Research Lab, Rural Technology Facility / Appropriate Technology Lab, Distributed Community (events and online communities with no permanent physical location), Art Space",patch@lifepatch.org,lifepatch.org,,http://facebook.com/lifepatch,110.3512,-7.8161,"Circuit Production, Electronics Lab, Farmland and/or Farming Equipment, Biological Science Equipment",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ermacora has curated a space focusing on socio-environmental impact technologies benefitting from the opportunities of distributed manufacturing, open source hardware development and participatory design.The ___Machines Room' will be open to visitors but particularly encourages ___makers in becoming' to use the facilities to prototype their ambitions, with resident makers available to coach them. It continues LimeWharf's experimental approach hybridising different known formats. There will be three different parts to the Machines Room: the Makerspace, where anyone, on a membership basis, can come and use the machinery, with demonstrations from resident makers; the Academy, where people can learn new technologies & skills; and an Incubator/Accelerator, where entrepreneurs can bring ideas to life.This addition to the already vibrant Cultural Innovation Hub which has a cafe, galleries, co-working spaces, artists and technologists in residence (Clear Village, TWSU and more), is a way to amplify the possibilities of creation onsite as well as inspiring locals of all generations that may not naturally go to a hackspace to learn about this emerging reality.The Machines Room's features include a laser cutter, vinyl cutter, Roland CNC, 3D printer, an electronics bench, a tool bench and sewing/embroidery machinery and an assortment of other kit invaluable to designers, artists, textile specialists and other product makers. The ___Machines Room' will fit in with the fabrication ecosystem in East London and be connected to the Fab Lab network as well as hosting a Maker Library in conjunction with the British Council.The long term ambition of the initiative is to give prosumers a serious play environment that can inspire socially impactful solutions for places in need, particularly within the developing world. Promoting an ethos of self-reliance whilst also providing a platform for entrepreneurs and people who want to make change through affordable innovation, the ___Machines Room' connects the dots between tech, enterprise and the arts.LimeWharf's founder, architect and curator, Thomas Ermacora, is a creative director and social entrepreneur, who wants to make the initiative an open-door ___ecosystem' for cultural innovation bringing together dynamics to the benefit of the surrounding area. ___There is a dreamer in all of us that can intuitively imagine the consequence of exponential technology developments today on the future of everything around us. Wikipedia combined with 3D printing is unleashing incomprehensible opportunities that makerspaces around are exploring.

Hackerspaces.org,,Europe,MADspace,,,,Netherlands,"Eindhoven, Nederland","Eindhoven, Noord Brabant",,"MADspace is a hackerspace in Eindhoven, The Netherlands.A hackerspace is a place where people can meet to share knowledge and ideas and to build things. The topics are often (but nor necessarily) science/technology related. For a bit more elaborate discription, you can look at the descriptions at Wikipedia or (Dutch) hackerspaces.nl.FacilitiesWe share our space with MADlab. Of course, life essentials are covered (space, power, internet, coffee/beer). Furthermore we can also make use of some tools present at MADlab (screwdrivers etc, but also soldering iron, multimeter, ___). We currently don't have any of the more expensive (but fun!) equipment such as 3D-printers, laser cutters, or other CNC-machines. But if there is serious interest among the members, we'll figure out if we can arrange those (keep in mind that we currently don't collect any membership fees).",Makerspace,Makerspace/Hackerspace,info@madspace.nl,madspace.nl,,,"51 26'10"""," 5 29'6""",,,,https://wiki.hackerspaces.org/MADspace,active,,,,,41442,,,40041,40,http://wiki.madspace.nl,,,Free,,,Eindhoven,Noord Brabant,,100 m2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Hackerspaces.org,,USA,Makers Local 256,,,,United States,"Makers Local 256, 414 Stevens Ave, 35801, Huntsville","Huntsville, Alabama", Alabama,"The organization has its genesis around the time Tech Shop in San Francisco opened and it was determined that something similar could be done locally without so much of the cost.  Soon a wiki was formed where ideas and projects began to get committed to something more than memory and in late October 2006 the first meeting was held.  This group of friends continued meeting nearly every weekend, working on projects and discussing new ideas.  Much debate was given toward a name before finally settling on Makers Local 256.  A name both reflecting who and where we are.  In 2008, the question was raised of how much money everyone could pledge monthly for a year toward getting a physical space, a method we still use today. We moved into our first space of a humble 750sqft a few months later.  During our first year we managed to incorporate as a 501(c)(3) non-profit and double membership beyond the original ten members.  Due to this growth and discovering what the old space was lacking, a new space of 2500sqft was located in April 2009. In May of 2011 Makers Local 256 moved again to an even larger facility in the Five points area of Huntsville. Makers Local 256 now sports a membership of over forty makers and continues to grow.",Makerspace,Makerspace/Hackerspace,,256.makerslocal.org,,,34.7444,-86.5794,,,,https://wiki.hackerspaces.org/Makers_Local_256,active,,,http://www.ustream.tv/channel/makers-local-256,https://lists.makerslocal.org/mailman/listinfo/general,41808,,irc://irc.freenode.net/#makerslocal,39527,70,https://256.makerslocal.org/wiki,,,"Members set their own donation amounts, and are requested to make the consistent donation every month.",,,Huntsville,Alabama,,4000 sqft,"34_ 44' 40"", -86_ 34' 46""",,"Makers Local 256, Huntsville, AL 35801, USA","34.7448168, -86.579383",https://maps.gstatic.com/mapfiles/place_api/icons/geocode-71.png,687f8dd7b483147babc45b1c864ae42c3fd4d29e,ChIJ5WU5w7QUYogRXSqeC67OokM,Makers Local 256,,,[u'premise'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Makers' Lab started like most things, a simple seed waiting to grow.  Marin Country Day School continues to water and nurture this seed which has grown to include five distinct spaces or environments each with unique attributes and players.  The environments continue to develop through a constant examination of what is possible with past, current and future technologies and materials in a digital landscape.  In Space 1, the germinating space, an electronics and tinkering space was born for 7 students.  This quickly became a nexus for those wanting to dive deep in the electromechanical realms in all ages.  This space was outgrown quickly and is still in use today.  Space 2 sprouted from the molten fragments of former cast off metal chunks and became a space to develop and manipulate in metal.  Welding, forging, and smithing shaped this small space for six students to work metal.  Space 3 grew out of a need for bigger tools and the need to involve the arts in our making discoveries.  A new art room has been slowly morphed to include 3d printers, foam milling, laser cutting, big wood working tools.  Space 3a was a natural ""burst at the seams"" location directly outside Space 3.  Material storage, big work benches, and an area to make messy.  Space 4 is in the gardens as the Makers' Lab met the gardening group for the development of sustainable and interesting aquaponics curriclum development.

Our aims are to find solutions for social problems as part of a sustainable working structure. At the same time our ideas and profits will be invested in an economically sustainable way. Therefore Added Value has a social and economic basis. Both will be jointly promoted through innovative structures and working methods creating a win-win situation. These financial resources will be integrated into a circulating system, and re-invested. Our social business allows the use of economic power to help to solve one of the great challenges of our time. We function as a social business pertaining to the idea that the economy must serve all people and not just increase the wealth of a few. We connect this idea with social innovation because as a professional team of designers and creative people the same questions keep on arising: How does innovation come into the world? How can it be harnessed to work and provide assistance? We follow the approach that real social innovation changes the system in which specific problems have emerged. It transforms the long term perception, behavior and the structures of the system itself. So the solution is not to house people in emergency situations with makeshift shelters, but provide them with buildings that serve as tools for a better future.

Through exhibitions, projects, education and exchange, we cultivate, support and challenge artists, creating room for new forms of expression and dialogue to thrive in Vietnam.We work towards our mission by:-Exhibition:âSupporting local âyoung and emerging artistsWe engage and nurture artists by organizing monthly exhibitions, volunteer programs, workshops and through providing mentorship opportunities-Education:âExpanding audiences for visual artsOur programming includes open studios, artist talks, and film screenings to foster dialogue between audiences and artists. We will open courses on understanding and practising contemporary art in the near future.-Exchange:âDomestic and international exchange. âNha San Collective builds from Nha San StudioÑs rich history of domestic and international art exchange. We organize solo and collaborative exhibitions, workshops, and seminars, providing âopportunities for sharing experiences, knowledge, and encouraging artistic practice between artists in many different social, economic and geo-political contexts.ââHISTORYNh” S”n Studio (NSS)âwas founded in 1998 by artists Nguyen Manh Duc and Tran Luong. It was the first and is, to date, the longest running non-profit experimental art space in Vietnam. The studio nurtured several generations of the most imaginative and daring contemporary artists in the country. ââThe studio, housed in NguyenÑs family home, is a Muong ethnic minority house on stilts that was transplanted from the mountains to a neighborhood in the outskirts of Hanoi. Opening intermittently, Nh” S”n created space for experimentation and community.Nh” S”n Studio quickly became a nexus for international art exchange: hosting lectures, and workshops, sound, video, installation and performance art. Along with providing artists with the chance to experiment with art forms distinct from state pedagogy and commercial markets, Nh” S”n connected local artists with opportunities for exchange abroad, and hosted a wide range of âinternational projects, and artists in Vietnam. âNh” S”n Studio nurtured the first generation of Vietnamese avant-garde artists emergent in the early 1990Ñs. These artist include Truong Tan, Tran Luong, Nguyen Van Cuong, Nguyen Minh Thanh, Nguyen Quang Huy, Ea Sola, Nguyen Manh Hung, Pham Ngoc Duong, Nguyen Minh Phuoc and Kim NgocNha San continues âto be valuable resource for an emerging generation of artists, including Nguyen Trinh Thi, Nguyen Phuong Linh, Nguyen Tran Nam, Nguyen Huy An, The Appendix, Nguyen Quoc Thanh and Tuan Mami.",Gallery,Gallery,,nhasan.org,,https://www.facebook.com/NhaSanCollective,105.863122,21.012445,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,http://movement.open.co/sites/default/files/styles/medium/public/Untitled%202.png?itok=b4VA7Acc,"Learning, Making, Celebrating","Culture, Education",Physical,National,,,,,"15th Floor, Hanoi Creative City building ",No.1 Luong Yen street,Hanoi,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Hackerspaces.org,,USA,NuclearHackerSpace,,,,United States,"836 Maine Street, 62301, Quincy","Quincy, Illinois", Illinois,"Hello denizens of Hackerspace,This is an attempt at building a HackerSpace node dedicated to, among other things, Hacking the Periodic Table, Constructing nuclear related devices and toys to help enhance public understanding of nuclear interactions and foster insights for more toys.  An example of such is: The Philosopher's Stone: Take one smoke alarm, secure the Americium 241 source, apply Beryllium in any form, cover with 3 centimeters of paraffin wax (minimum thickness) apply material to be transmuted into another place on the Periodic Table (any Bismuth material), for example, and place the device in a secure and radiologically shielded are and let it build mass of the transmuted material.  This device is a universal nuclear transmuting engine...the Philosopher's Stone. When Bismuth is the target, Bismuth 210 is produced, which has a half-life of five days. Bismuth 210, by beta decay, becomes Polonium 210.  Here in America, I have distributed the working plans for this universal device to the Patriots and other interested Citizens to enable restoration of our Constitutional Republic.  The idea is to remove the Communists, Socialists and Globalists from our Constitutional Republic with Polonium 210.  Check Wiki for Polonium 210 poisoning for perspective. This device will also bring about nuclear fission of Uranium ore by spallation.  Nearly all elements may be transmuted by spallation with this device. This device was used as the nuclear trigger for atomic fission before Plutonium 239 was substituted. Polonium 210 has such a short half-life that regular replacement was required. Plutonium 239 has much longer half-life. I welcome input, suggestions, experiences, Lab techniques and other information of related interest.  Albert T.

fab_lab,,Europe,ON/OFF Fablab Parma,,,,Italy,"Strada Naviglio Alto, 4/1,  43125, Follow the sign to ""ON/OFF""","Parma, Emilia Romagna",,"Education, technology, social innovation, Heritage Lab, On/off Fablab Parma is a very young (open in April 2014) and very active mini fablab. We have been helped by Francesco Bombardi and Fernando Arias of the Fablab Reggio-Emilia, Andrea Danielli of Make in Italy association and Massimo Menichinelli of Make in Italy CDB fundation Onlus. After visiting several Fablabs in Italy (Fablab Torino, Fablab Reggio-Emilia, MakeinBo) and done our homework of studying several fablab in Europe (Fablab Barcellona, Aalto Factory, etc) we decided that it was time to open a Fablab in Parma.ON/OFF Fablab Parma is a brainchild of ""ON/OFF Officina di Coworking"" which is a innovative service of the office of the Mayor of Parma and it is managed by ""Gruppo Scuola"" in collaboration with the Association of Social Promotion ON/OFF.ON/OFF is a three stages project divided in CO-MAKE-SELL: COWORKING - FABLAB - MAKER'S SHOP.The Coworking opened its doors on the 23rd of November 2013with the main goal to promote an aggregation point of freelancers and Startups. Currently we have people from different sectors from webdesigners, software engineers, film makers, journalists, writers, illustrators, graphic designers, European funding researchers, app developer, etc.Recently On/off partner also with an incubator (Parma-in)for Start-ups.The different skills has created an environment rich of creativity and sparked new business opportunity for the professionals working there.The help of the local government of Parma has been essential to help the growing of the project, since they helped giving the use of the location were at the moment the Coworking if base and where the Fablab has a place to live. The Fablab is looking for a bigger place since we are growing in number of associated and in number of Tools at the disposal of the community.On/Off is also a universe made of space for artist to expose their work, for designer to create their clothes to the several workshops we have done till now.WE are very weary and it is of paramount importance to educate for this we work together with local schools and showing the interesting world of the 3d Printing, or with coderdojo teaching the beauty of coding software to young kids.We are doing several courses to introduce the 3D printing revolution open to everyone and we are in the process to work on a new calendar of workshops starting in September/October 2014.We are part of the ""virtuous network"" it's a network of organization who manage to be in continuos connection with the local people, being self-sustainable and create a link between the people and the territory where they live.The coworkers and fabbers give back to the community as volunteer on several social projects, this is part of the mission we agree when we enter in ON/OFF Coworiking and Fablab and this is the reason the price of admission to use the services is lower than other places, because we give back to the community of Parma. At the moment we fulfilled only two stages of the project: the Coworking and the Fablab. At the moment we are working on the next phase, thus the Maker's shop, where the digital manufacturing artisan and artist will have a physical place where to sell their creations and where the services of the Coworking and the Fablab will be offered to the local community. We are young in respect of other Fablab but we are very lucky since we have a great community with amazing competences.At the moment we are working on implementing a robotic hand within the Fablab and We aim with one of the group to research and produce a low cost prosthesis arm and hand and tools for disabled people.We are working on an original 3D Printer the Coobot of one of our group 3DPR.We are working on how to create objects with 3D printers to help Blind people in the museum to recognize and touch a smaller version of a statue for example, this is done by the 3D ArcheoLab group.We have already partecipated and show our project during:- Torino Mini Maker Faire;- Rome Maker Faire;- New York Maker Faire;- 3D Print Hub profesional faire in Parma (Mecspe) and in Bologna (Exposanit‹î);- R2B part of Smau in Bologna;- FAB10 Barcellona.In the Fablab we have the following groups:- Biohacking in collaboration with Fabiana Ciciriello;- Fablab kids (for kids from 4 to 14 years old) with Michela Grasselli and ""Le quattro Mani"";- Heritage Lab in collaboration with 3D ARCHEOLAB and Giulio Bigliardi;- Wearable and Fashion technology.Last but not least we are part of Mak-ER the regional network of Fablabs of the Region Emilia Romagna.

Shri Veer Shing Marg, Old Fatehpura, Udaipur, Rajasthan 313004",Udaipur,Rajasthan,"After fifty years of so-called development efforts, and despite great  scientific advancements, India (and the rest of the world) finds itself  mired in a paralyzing socio-cultural, environmental and spiritual  crisis - overwhelming in its scale, intensity and rate of growth.  While education has been framed as the cure to this  crisis, in reality, the factory model of schooling is part of the  problem. Around the world, education systems have become commercialized  'businesses' which serve to stratify society, glorify militarism,  devalue local knowledge systems and languages, manufacture unsustainable  wants, breed discontent and frustration, stifle creativity, motivation  and expression, and dehumanize communities. The  19th-century model of factory-schooling today stands in the way  of building organic learning societies for the 21st century. There is an urgent need to start thinking differently  if we wish to do things differently. This starts with facing the  reality that the problems that threaten to overwhelm and destroy  India arise from the 'schooled', not from the so-called illiterates.  Thus, expanding or reforming the existing system of factory-schooling  (whether through schools, distance education, literacy classes or  non-formal centers) will not solve the crisis. Rather, communities must engage in new modes of lifelong  societal learning which grow from a larger understanding of and  respect for human potential and human dignity, dynamic learning  processes and relationships, pluralistic identities and cultural  contexts, the human spirit and its connection to the web of life.  The challenge before us then is to engage in processes of transdisciplinary  reflection, dialogue, vision-building and experimentation in order  to: provoke, challenge and dismantle factory-schooling andconstruct and connect new open learning communities",Makerspace,"makerspace, farm, community","shikshantar@yahoo.com, manish@swaraj.org",swaraj.org/shikshantar,(91) 294-245-1303,https://www.facebook.com/pages/Shikshantar-Andolan/126196370730355?sk=timeline,28.6423453,77.2426709,,"Shikshantar seeks to explore swaraj in our lives.

It is a living community and an organic, ever-developing concept in the hearts and minds of every participant, which endeavours to catalyse the local IP entrepreneurial community.    The initiative aims firstly to start a conversation -- to plant a seed and foster the concept of the Silicon Cape in people___s minds and on their lips around the world as the emerging Silicon Valley of Africa, and to assist in the creation of an environment and a perception of the area as a world-class location and destination that is not only capable of delivering but already is.

Opposite the police station and next to the medical clinic. Nad Al Sheba 1.","Dubai,",,"Tashkeel is a not-for-profit organisation based in Dubai committed to facilitating innovation, particularly in art and design practice, supporting creative experimentation and cross-cultural dialogue. Established in 2008 by Lateefa bint Maktoum, Tashkeel is a not-for-profit organisation based in Dubai committed to facilitating innovation, particularly in art and design practice, supporting creative experimentation and cross-cultural dialogue.  Tashkeel supports the UAE's creative community through studio facilities, residencies, international fellowships, a programme of exhibitions, events and professional, educational as well as recreational workshops. The facilities include a digital lab, 3D lab (including large scale laser cutter), darkrooms, print studios (lino, litho, screen printing and etching), library, individual and communal studio spaces.   Tashkeel currently runs up to three residencies a year, along with 6 residencies in conjunction with partner entities - Delfina Foundation London, Dubai Culture and Arts Authority and Art Dubai. Encouraging the exchange of ideas between international and local practitioners, the non-prescriptive and process-based nature of the residencies allows visiting artists to develop projects in response to their new context, or to conduct research benefiting from Tashkeel's resources. Residencies generally culminate in an exhibition, accompanied by activities such as talks and seminars, aiming to introduce the general public to international artists and their practice.  Tashkeel's exhibition space accommodates up to five main projects a year, as well as a series of small-scale events. The programme includes solo and thematic exhibitions, screenings, workshops and seminars, fulfilling Tashkeel's commitment to bringing art and culture to a wider audience and engaging the local community.   We partner with both international and UAE based institutions - providing participants of their varied projects with free access to all our facilities and in exchange they host workshops or talks in their various disciplines - including, Architecture Association Visiting School, PAL Labs UK, NYU Abu Dhabi, Zayed University and American University of Sharjah. We also run both professional development and school workshops supporting students and professionals from a range of disciplines.",Fab Lab,Fab Lab,tamsin_wildy@tashkeel.org,tashkeel.org,97143363313,,25.15591,55.323574,"laser, vinyl_cutting, ","Tashkeel is a not-for-profit organisation based in Dubai committed to facilitating innovation, particularly in art and design practice, supporting creative experimentation and cross-cultural dialogue.",https://www.fablabs.io/tashkeelfablab,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This strategy is pivoted on establishing environmental fundamentals for the build-up of self-sustaining zones in specific industrial sectors such as Tourism, Energy Services, Health, Entertainment and ICT, each as a special component of an integrated economic zone where regulations, skills, infrastructure, and governance are all geared towards facilitating a targeted economic development.  The Tinapa Knowledge City (TKC) project, an initiative of the Cross River State Government (CRSG)with support from the National Information Technology Development Agency (NITDA), will evolve into the establishment of a digital knowledge hub in the West and Central African sub region. It follows similar concepts that have been implemented and are operational in various parts of the developed and developing world. The project aims to provide world-class operational facilities, infrastructure, and services for the development of a viable industrial cluster that will attract mature technology businesses from Nigeria and abroad. It will also promote maturing businesses by offering globally competitive support services they require to attain long-term stability and profitability. Overall, the TKC when fully realised in partnership with complementary organizations such as universities, research institutions and incubators will encourage the formation and growth of knowledge-based businesses in the Information and Communication Technology (ICT) sector and other sectors. It will actively support information and communication technology brokering and enhance the business prospects of tenant firms. TKC will facilitate knowledge and technology transfer to the broader local economy thereby acting as a catalyst for job and wealth creation.    TKC is located in a 10,000sqm facility in the famous Tinapa Business Resort which provides world-class infrastructure required to set up the Technology and Business Park. These include: modern office complexes, 24x7 electricity supply, security, broadband internet (STM-1) etc. in _green_ layout, proximity to Calabar International Airport; strategically located in the most active Free Trade Zone on the West/Central African axes .  Opening in April 2013 with a Software Incubator, followed in October 2013 by a full launch of a bouquet of fully-equipped services, TKC will provide a launch pad for unleashing innovation and diversifying the economic potentials of the state, national and regional economy.",Incubator,"Technology Hubs,Business Incubators,HackerSpaces",info@tinapaknowledgecity.com,gcafrica.net,,https://africahubs.crowdmap.com/reports/view/110,4.95,8.325,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
