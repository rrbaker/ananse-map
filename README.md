# ananse-map

We are creating an open-source (license TBD) map/database for all the innovation spaces everywhere! This Atlas will merge existing lists of community innovation spaces from disparate maps onto a single, open-source platform— with an API so our data can be easily shared across other platforms. A tagging system will enable all spaces to share goals and find collaborators across interests such as electronic waste, prosthetics, 3D printing, primary education, green materials, water purification, etc. 

We have three primary criteria for including a given “community innovation space” on our map:

1. Community: a physical space or event that is eager to collaborate with others-- it must be either open to the public or available for outside partnerships

2. Technology: utilizes old and/or new technology, including hardware, software, metal-working, handicrafts, repurposed trash, farming, etc.

3. Innovation: promotes creativity and nurtures new ideas

From July through October 2016, our team will develop, test, and then implement the platform to collaboratively host all these spaces.
